        <p>One of the most valuable things that I have learned that I think is important is that I learned how to do more complex math equations which will help me in highschool math. We learned to find the area of a <b>triangle</b>, and how to make <b>visual</b> effects in desmos, and how to <b>transmit</b> a download to our math google classroom. We were taught how a thermostat works and how to change the temperature, and how outerspace is a vacuum, and that survival in outer space if something goes wrong would be fatal and would result in death and releasing toxic chemicals from the carcass. There are people that are good at riding a Unicycle for money.
